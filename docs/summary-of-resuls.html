<p>This sections present the results obtained with the models for the three development indicators: median income, literacy and poverty rates. Goodness of fit statistics are presented both at the <em>segmento</em> level and at the <em>municipio</em> level. In the latter case, the results are presented with models fitted either on the entire datasets or for the 50 representative <em>municipios</em> only. Lastly, we present the map of predicted income, literacy and poverty rates as well as uncertainty maps.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Goodness of fit at the <em>segmento</em> level</h2>
<p>Various models were tested for the three development indicators. Spatial dependence was modeled either with a Besag-York-Mollie model (BYM 2) or with a SPDE model. Backward selection process was adopted, starting from the same set of covariates. For the income model, we tested both a Gaussian and a gamma likelihood function. Both literacy and poverty are ratio data, they are hence bounded between 0 and 100%. We therefore used a beta model. As beta distribution cannot include 0 and 1, we added and subtracted <span class="math inline">\(0.00001\)</span> to observation with 0 or 1, respectively. We also tested for both models the goodness of fit of Gaussian model.</p>
<p>We also investigated the use zero-inflated and zero-altered beta models for literacy and poverty. For poverty, we also tested two separate model for rural and urban <em>segmentos</em>. This did not yield any noticable improvement in the goodness of fit of the model. We therefore do not present the codes and results for these more complex models.</p>
<p>We start by loading the model summaries.</p>

<p>For income, the best model is the SPDE one with a <em>Gamma</em> likelihood function and where stepwise covariate selection has been applied. The goodness of fit is relatively high (50%) and holds in test set.</p>
<p>For literacy, the three tested models yield results which are very close from each other in terms of goodness of fit. We select the SPDE one with stepwise covariate selection, with a goodness of fit of 43%, a final model.</p>
<p>However, the model on moderate poverty doesn’t have a good fit: the goodness of fit of the best model is only 23%. We selected the <em>Gaussian</em> with SPDE and stepwise selection as final model.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> <em>Segmento</em> level map</h2>
<p>It is now finally time to produce the maps. The detailed process to produce the map is shown for income with the SPDE model. Codes are not shown for literacy and poverty. So far, prediction have been only made on the <em>segmentos</em> for which EHPM data are available, i.e. on 1664 <em>segmentos</em>. To complete the map, prediction have to be made on the whole 12,435 <em>segmentos</em> of El Salvador.</p>
<p>We prepare two data stacks: one covers for the 1664 EHPM <em>segmentos</em> and one for the remaining 10’771 where no EHPM data are available. In the latter <em>segmentos</em>, we have however the covariates data. The model will be trained on the EHPM <em>segmentos</em> and out of sample prediction will be made on the non-EHPM <em>segmentos</em>.</p>

<p>The fitted values are accessed thanks to the <code>inla.stack.index</code> introduced in the previous sections. We also extract the standard deviation of the prediction in order to map the uncertainty of the prediction. The latter is summarized by the coefficient of variation. For any given <em>segmento</em> <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, the coefficient of variation is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
coef var_{s}=\hat{\sigma_{s}}/\hat{\mu_{s}} 
\end{aligned}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma_{s}}\)</span> is the standard deviation of the prediction for <em>segmento</em> <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu_{s}}\)</span> is the average predicted income for <em>segmemto</em> <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The coefficient of variation is hence the standard deviation of the prediction expressed in percentage of the prediction.</p>

<div id="goodness-of-fit-at-the-municipio-level" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Goodness of fit at the <em>Municipio</em> level</h2>
<p>We can now investigate the goodness of fit at the <em>municipio</em> level. We adopt two methods for doing so.</p>
<p>First, we aggregate the results at the <em>municipio</em> level and compare them with <em>municipio</em> level statistics. An issue with this approach is that in each <em>municipio</em>, some <em>segmentos</em> are used in the training and validation sets. Furthermore, EHPM data are representative at the municipio level only for a subset of <em>municipios</em>. The difference between fitted and observed values will hence be affected both by modelling errors and sampling errors while it will be hard to gauge the external validity of the model as the training and validation sets are mixed.</p>
<p>To remedy this, we also adopt a second approach. We select the <em>segmentos</em> from representative <em>municipios</em> only. We then split this remaining dataset into a training and validation sets, making sure that all <em>segmentos</em> from any given <em>municipio</em> fall either in the training or the validation set. We can then obtain goodness of fit statistics at the <em>municipio</em> level for observations which have not been used to train the model.</p>
<div id="obtion-1-aggregating-results-at-the-municipio-level-using-all-segmentos" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Obtion 1: Aggregating results at the municipio level using all <em>segmentos</em></h3>
<p>First we compute the average <em>segmento</em> median income level on the entire sample at the municipio level. We then compute the average prediction of the test set at the <em>municipio</em> level. Finally, we compare observed average income against predicted average income at the <em>municipio</em> level, both for the representative and non-representative <em>municipios</em>.</p>

Figure 6.12: Predicted vs Observed Moderate Poverty rate: Municipio level, entire sample
</p>
</div>
<p>The goodness of fit is much better for the representative <em>municipios</em> (in green) than for the non-representative ones (in red). In the latter ones, the goodness of fit is affected both by the model errors and the sampling errors. Furthermore, it is hard to take the goodness of fit statistics for the representative <em>segmentos</em> as face values as they are based on a mixed of training and validation data. We therefore re-run the model below with only the <em>segmentos</em> in representative <em>municipios</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.2</span> Option 2: Aggregating results at the municipio level using only <em>segmentos</em> in representative municipios</h3>
<p>We select only the <em>segmentos</em> in representative <em>municipios</em> and allocate <em>municipios</em> to a training and validation set. This insure that all <em>segmentos</em> from each <em>municipio</em> are either in the training and validation set. There is a total of 50 representative <em>municipios</em> in the EHPM, totaling 1114 <em>segmentos</em>.</p>
<p>The only change compared to the code shown in the earlier sections is the creation of the training and validation set. The process is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Allocate representative <em>municipios</em> into a training and validation set;</li>
<li>Select the data for the <em>segmentos</em> in representative <em>municipios</em>;</li>
<li>Add the <em>municipio</em> training and validation set indexes to the <em>segmento</em> level dataframe.</li>
