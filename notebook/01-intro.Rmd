# Overview {#overview}
This analysis aims to create a high-resolution map of poverty, income, and literacy for El Salvador. The data on these three development indicators come from the 2017 EHPM household survey. While the survey data are available for only 1,664 *segmentos*, the smallest (local) administrative units, the goal is to provide a map of the three development indicators for all 12,435 segmentos in the country. 

This is made possible by building a statistical model exploiting the relationship between RS data (e.g., lights at night measured from a satellite, precipitation), the EHPM survey data, and the spatial correlation between SDG outcomes across space. Once the relationship between the EHPM survey data and the RS data is modeled in locations where EHPM survey data are available, RS data, which are available for the entire country, are used to predict SDG outcomes across the entire country. Furthermore, as SDG outcomes of two segmentos are more likely to be similar if both segmentos are neighbors than if they are far away from each other, the accuracy of the spatial prediction can be enhanced by explicitly into account the spatial distances and spatial relationships between the segmentos. 

The interpolation technique we use in this report is based on Bayesian geospatial methods implemented in the open-source statistical computing environment R [@R2018]. The core of the modeling method is implemented in the R package `INLA` [@INLA_theory_1;@INLA_theory_2;@INLA_R_1;@INLA_R_2]. 

Several other R packages are used in this tutorial. The main ones are `dplyr` [@dplyr] for data handling, `plotly` [@plotly] for interactive plots, `leaflet` [@leaflet] for interactive maps, `raster` [@raster] for raster data, `rgdal` [@rgdal] for vector files, `sp` [@sp] for coordinates systems adjustments, `energy` [@energy] for distance correlation computations, and `parallel` [@parallel] for the covariates selection process.  

These are the five main steps of the analysis:

1.  Data preprocessing
2.  Covariate preselection
3.  Model fitting
4.  Diagnostic checks
5.  Out-of-sample spatial interpolation to create high-resolution maps

A brief introduction to the INLA method is provided in Section \@ref(theory). Three books are recommended for those who are interested in more information on the INLA approach: 

*   For readers with only a minimal quantitative background: *Beginner's Guide to Spatial, Temporal, and Spatial-Temporal Ecological Data Analysis with R-INLA* [@zuur2017beginner]  
*   For those willing to delve deeper into the methodology behind INLA: *Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Models with R-INLA* [@blangiardo2015spatial]
*   For those interested in an application for public health: *Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny*[@moraga2019geospatial]

Bakka et al. [@Bakka] provide a good overview of spatial modeling with `INLA`, and Steele et al. [@steele2017mapping] provide a great example of the use of `INLA` for poverty mapping.

## The First Look at the Data 
A total of 20,609 households were interviewed in the 2017 EHPM. The EHPM data are collected in 1,664  of El Salvador’s 12,435 segmentos. The number of households interviewed per segmento is mapped in Figure \@ref(fig:map-1). 
 
Here are the required steps to create the map: 

* Load the required packages: `rgdal`, `dplyr` and `leaflet`. 
* Load the Segmentos shapefile with `rgdal` and the list of households per segmento.
* Count the number of households per segmento with `dplyr` and identify the segmentos where at least one survey recipient exists. 
* Map the results with `leaflet`. 

To begin, we load the packages and initial data with `rgdal`.
```{r results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load the packages
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)
#source("../utils.R")

# Modify the directory path “dir_data” to where you stored the data
root_dir="~/"
project_dir="data/"

dir_data=paste0(root_dir,project_dir)

# Load the segmento shapefile map (simplified for faster rendering)
segmentos_to_map=readOGR(paste0(dir_data,
                       "spatial/shape/admin/STPLAN_Segmentos_simplified.shp")) 
# Load the households list surveyed in the EHPM per segmento
id_segmento_2017=readxl::read_xlsx(paste0(dir_data,
                                        "tables/Identificador de segmento.xlsx"),
                                 sheet = 2)  
```

We then compute the number of participants per segmento with `dplyr`.
```{r results="hide"}
id_segmento_2017_df=id_segmento_2017%>% 
  rename(SEG_ID=seg_id)%>% 
  group_by(SEG_ID)%>% # Group data per segmento
  summarize(ehpm_2017_d=1, # 1 if there is a household in the segmento
            ehpm_2017_n=n()) # # Count the number of households per segmento with the function n()
```

Before merging the results with the shapefile, we change the identifier of segmentos in the shapefile, "SEG_ID", into character format. This is to make sure the match between the SEG_ID stored as a character in the household list `id_segmento_2017_df` and the shapefile map `segmentos` is correct.

```{r results="hide"}
segmentos_to_map@data=segmentos_to_map@data%>%
  mutate(SEG_ID=as.character(SEG_ID))%>% # Turn SEG_ID into character format
  left_join(id_segmento_2017_df, # Merge the household list with the shapefile data
            by="SEG_ID")
```

We can now map all the segmentos where the EHPM data have been collected with the package `leaflet`. Note that when running the next command, rendering the 12,435 shapes might take a while.

```{r map-1-chunk, eval=T,  fig.width=3, fig.height=3,fig.show='hold',fig.align='center',cache=TRUE,fig.cap='Number of Participants Surveyed per Segmento'}
leaflet(segmentos_to_map) %>% # Leaflet is used to render the map
     addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)%>%
  addPolygons(color = "#444444", # Color of the line of the border of each segmento
              weight = 1,  # Thickness of the line of the border of each segmento
              smoothFactor = 1, # Simplify the shape to speed rendering
              opacity = 0, # Opacity of the segmento border lines
              fillOpacity = 1, # Opacity of the segmento areas
              fillColor = ~colorQuantile("Greens",  # Define the color ramps of polygons 
                                         ehpm_2017_n,na.color = "transparent")(ehpm_2017_n)) 
```

```{r map-1,eval=F, echo=FALSE,out.width = '100%',fig.cap='Number of Participants Surveyed per Segmento'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/map_1_ehpm.PNG")

```

Our modeling exercise obtains estimates of income, literacy, and poverty for the segmentos where no EHPM data is available, which are the empty values in Figure \@ref(fig:map-1).
