# Overview {#overview}
The aim of the analysis is to create a high resolution map of poverty, income and literacy for El Salvador. The data on these three development indicators come from the 2017 household survey *Encuesta de Hogares de Propositos Multiples* (EHPM). While the survey data are only available for 1,664 *segmentos*, the lowest administrative units, the goal is to provide a map of the three development indicators for all the 12,435 *segmentos* of the country. 

This is made possible by building a statistical model exploiting the relationship between remote sensed (RS) data (e.g. lights a night measured from satellite, precipitation), the EHPM survey data and the spatial correlation between SDGs outcomes across space. Once the relationship between the EHPM survey data and the RS data is modeled in locations where EHPM survey data are available, RS data, which are available for the entire country, are used to predict SDG outcomes across the entire country. Furthermore, as SDG outcomes of two *segmentos* are more likely to be similar if both *segmentos* are neighbours than if they are far away from each other, the accuracy of the spatial prediction can be enhanced by taking explicitly into account the spatial distances and spatial relationships between *segmentos*. 

The interpolation technique we use in this report is based on Bayesian geospatial methods implemented in the open source statistical computing environment R [@R2018]. The core of the modelling method is implemented in the R package `INLA` [@INLA_theory_1;@INLA_theory_2;@INLA_R_1;@INLA_R_2]. 

Several other R packages are used in this tutorial. The main ones are `dplyr` [@dplyr] for data handling, `plotly` [@plotly] for interactive plots, `leaflet` [@leaflet] for interactive maps,  `raster` [@raster] for handling raster data, `rgdal`  [@rgdal] for loading vector files, `sp` [@sp] for adjusting coordinates systems, `energy` [@energy] to compute distance correlation and `parallel` [@parallel] to parallise the covariates selection process.  

These are the five main steps of the analysis:

1.  Data pre-processing
2.  Covariate pre-selection
3.  Model fitting
4.  Diagnostic checks
5.  Out of sample spatial interpolation to create high resolution maps.

A brief introduction to the INLA method is provided in Section \@ref(theory). Three books are recommended for those willing to get more information on the INLA approach: 

*   for readers with only a minimal quantitative background: *Beginner's Guide to Spatial, Temporal, and Spatial-Temporal Ecological Data Analysis with R-Inla* [@zuur2017beginner],  
*   for those willing to delve deeper in the methodology behind INLA: *Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Models with R-Inla* [@blangiardo2015spatial].
*   for those interested by an application to public health: *Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny*[@moraga2019geospatial]

Bakka et al. [@Bakka] provide a good overview of spatial modelling with `INLA` and  Steele et al. [@steele2017mapping] provide a great example of the use of `INLA` for poverty mapping.

## First look at the data 
A total of 20,609 households are interviewed in the 2017 EHPM. The EHPM data are collected in 1,664 *segmentos* out of the 12,435 *segmentos* of El Salvador. The number of households interviewed per *segmento* is mapped on Fig \@ref(fig:map-1). 
 
Here are the required steps to create the map: 

* load the required packages: `rgdal`, `dplyr` and `leaflet`; 
* Load the: 
    + segmentos shapefile with `rgdal`,
    + list of households per *segmento*; 
* count the number of households per *segmento* with `dplyr` and identify the segmentos where at least 1 survey recipient exists; 
* map the results with `leaflet`. 

Let us start by loading packages and the initial data with `rgdal`.
```{r results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)
#source("../utils.R")

# modify dir_data to where you stored the data
root_dir="~/"
project_dir="data/"

dir_data=paste0(root_dir,project_dir)

# load segemento shapefile map (simplified for faster rendering):
segmentos_to_map=readOGR(paste0(dir_data,
                       "spatial/shape/admin/STPLAN_Segmentos_simplified.shp")) 
# load the households list surveyed in the EHPM per segmento:
id_segmento_2017=readxl::read_xlsx(paste0(dir_data,
                                        "tables/Identificador de segmento.xlsx"),
                                 sheet = 2)  
```

We then compute the number of participants per *segmento* with `dplyr`.
```{r results="hide"}
id_segmento_2017_df=id_segmento_2017%>% 
  rename(SEG_ID=seg_id)%>% 
  group_by(SEG_ID)%>% # group data per segmento
  summarise(ehpm_2017_d=1, # 1 if there is hh in the segmento
            ehpm_2017_n=n()) # # count number of household per segmento with the function n()
```

Before merging the results with the shapefile, let us turn the identifier of segmentos in the shapefile, "SEG_ID", into character format. This is to make sure the match between the SEG_ID stored as a character in the household list `id_segmento_2017_df` and the shapefile map `segmentos` is correct.

```{r results="hide"}
segmentos_to_map@data=segmentos_to_map@data%>%
  mutate(SEG_ID=as.character(SEG_ID))%>% # turn SEG_ID into character format
  left_join(id_segmento_2017_df, # merge the household list with the shapefile data
            by="SEG_ID")
```

We can now map all the *segmentos* where the EHPM data have been collected. This is done with the package `leaflet`. Please be patient when running the next command: rendering the 12,435 shapes might take a bit of time.

```{r map-1-chunk, eval=T,  fig.width=3, fig.height=3,fig.show='hold',fig.align='center',cache=TRUE,fig.cap='Number of participants surveyed per segmento'}
leaflet(segmentos_to_map) %>% # leaflet is used to render the map
     addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)%>%
  addPolygons(color = "#444444", # color of the line of the border of each segmento
              weight = 1,  # thickness of the line of the border of each  segmento
              smoothFactor = 1, # simplify the shape to speed rendering
              opacity = 0, # opacity of the segmento border lines
              fillOpacity = 1, # opacity of the segmento areas
              fillColor = ~colorQuantile("Greens",  # define the color ramps of polygons 
                                         ehpm_2017_n,na.color = "transparent")(ehpm_2017_n)) 
```

```{r map-1,eval=F, echo=FALSE,out.width = '100%',fig.cap='Number of participants surveyed per segmento'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/map_1_ehpm.PNG")

```

The aim of our modelling exercise is to obtain estimates of income, literacy and poverty for the *segmentos* where no EHPM data is available, i.e. for the blanks on Fig. \@ref(fig:map-1).
